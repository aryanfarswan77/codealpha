TASK1: DEVELOPING A CHATBOT 
Overview of the Task and Code 

In this v, I showcase a functional chatbot that handles various questions related to engineering. The chatbot is designed to provide accurate and relevant responses to queries about engineering branches, skills for future engineers, and more. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to interpret user input and generate appropriate answers. The code leverages both NLTK and SpaCy for tokenization and entity recognition, ensuring a robust and reliable performance. Key highlights include:

NLTK for tokenization and fallback to SpaCy for additional text processing.
Custom logic to identify intents and match questions with appropriate responses from a predefined knowledge base.
Handling various user queries with precise and contextually relevant answers.

Throughout this project, I utilized the following skills:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Employed NLTK and SpaCy for text tokenization and entity recognition.
Python Programming: Developed and implemented the chatbot functionality using Python.
Intent Recognition: Designed and coded logic to identify user intents and provide accurate responses.
Software Development: Applied best practices in software development and testing to ensure the chatbot's reliability and effectiveness.


TASK2: TRANSLATOR
 I‚Äôve developed a simple and efficient language translation tool using machine translation techniques. This tool allows users to translate text from one language to another by simply inputting the language name instead of codes, making it more user-friendly.
üîß Task Overview:
Utilized Google‚Äôs googletrans library to translate text based on language names.
Implemented error handling for invalid inputs and ensured smooth translations between multiple languages.
üõ† Skills Used:
Python Programming
Machine Translation
Error Handling and User Input Management

TASK3: 
This task is about building a Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking System using deep learning models like Faster R-CNN. üéØ This project involves detecting and tracking objects in live video streams, enabling real-time insights through advanced computer vision techniques.
üîç Task Overview:
Developed a system capable of detecting and tracking objects in real-time.
Used PyTorch and Faster R-CNN for object detection.
Integrated OpenCV for handling real-time video streams.
üí° Key Skills Used:
Deep Learning
Computer Vision
Object Detection and Tracking
PyTorch and OpenCV
